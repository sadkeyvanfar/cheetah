# Status
This project is currently a work-in-progress.
If you execute "mvn install" or "mvn package", you will get a distribution package that you can unpack. This will give you the Cheetah application jar and all of the dependencies - you can simply execute java -jar cheetah.jar and the application should start.
On the other hand, just run it from an Intellj IDEA project.
