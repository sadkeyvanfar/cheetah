# Status
This project is currently a work-in-progress.
If you execute maven goal "assembly:assembly", This will give you the Cheetah application jar and all of the dependencies - you can simply execute java -jar cheetah-...-jar-with-dependencies.jar and the application should start.

On the other hand, just run it from an Intellj IDEA project with Cheetah-With-Maven configuration.
